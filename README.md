# RTLSDR-Airband

NOTE: Changes as of upstream:
 - New configuration options for file output:
    - float min_rec_length - minimal record length (seconds), default to 1.0
    - float max_rec_length - maximum record length (seconds), default to 3600.0 (1 hour)
    - float max_idle_length - maximum idle length (seconds), default to 0.5
    - boolean delete_short_records - delete file, if record is shorter than min_rec_length
 - Changed dated subdirectories format: use c++ time template format with variable dated_subdir_format (default is "%d-%m-%y")
 - Changed output filename format: available suffix option "end_timestamp_format" (defaults to " TO %H-%M-%S" - pretend to be ProScan) bunch of options taken from SDR++ code, may be used for suffix and filename_template:
    - "%F" - frequency in Hz
    - "%kF" - frequency in kHz
    - "%MF" - frequency in MHz
    - "%H" - hours
    - "%M" - minutes 
    - "%S" - seconds
    - "%d" - day
    - "%m" - month
    - "%Y" - year in 4-digit format
    - "%y" - last 2 digits of year

Changes as of v5.1.0:
 - License is now GPLv2 [#503](https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband/discussions/503)

NOTE: Repo URL has moved to https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband see [#502](https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband/discussions/502) for info

Changes as of v5.0.0:
 - PRs will be opened directly against `main` and the `unstable` branch will no longer be used
 - Version tags will be automatically created on each merge to `main`
 - A release will be created on each `major` or `minor` version tag but not `minor` tags
 - Checking out `main` is recommended over using a release artifact to stay on the latest version
 - This repo has significantly diverged from the original project [microtony/RTLSDR-Airband](https://github.com/microtony/RTLSDR-Airband) so it has been been detached (ie no longer a fork).
 - Specific build support for `rpiv1`, `armv7-generic`, and `armv8-generic` have been deprecated for the new default `native`, see [#447](https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband/discussions/447)


## Overview

RTLSDR-Airband receives analog radio voice channels and produces
audio streams which can be routed to various outputs, such as online
streaming services like LiveATC.net. Originally the only SDR type
supported by the program was Realtek DVB-T dongle (hence the project's
name). However, thanks to SoapySDR vendor-neutral SDR library, other
radios are now supported as well.

## Documentation

User's manual is now on the [wiki](https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband/wiki).
